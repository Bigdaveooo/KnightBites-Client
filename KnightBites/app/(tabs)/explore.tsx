          We want this app to serve as a forum for Calvin students to rank and review the food served at the dining halls on campus.
          {'\n\n'}
          Our goal is to provide a platform for students to share their opinions and experiences with the Calvin community.
          {'\n\n'}
          Our hope is that this app will help students make informed decisions about where to eat on campus.
